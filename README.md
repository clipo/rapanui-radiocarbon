# rapanui-radiocarbon
A repository of radiocarbon data for Rapa Nui

This repository is intended to provide access to various tables of radiocarbon dates that exist for Rapa Nui. One challenge we have found in doing analyses of radiocarbon samples is that the data are often in tables as appendices but not included in an easy-to-share format (such as CSV). Thus when working on projects involving analyses of dates, one must painfully reenter the data. At the same time, many of these tables have errors in them as they reflect incorrectly coded data or typos. These problems mean that the data have to be updated/corrected. It is our intention for this repository to provide versions of the original data (so one can redo analyses as originally conducted by authors) but also corrected versions.
